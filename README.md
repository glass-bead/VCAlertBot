This Discord bot is designed to address the issue of users joining voice channels without any automatic notification to other server members. While text channel activities generate notifications, joining voice channels (VC) often goes unnoticed. This bot fills that gap by providing real-time notifications when someone joins a voice channel.

## Technologies Used

This bot is built using a variety of technologies, including:

* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/): A powerful and flexible library for interacting with the Discord API (version 14.14.1)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about): A popular server-side JavaScript runtime (version 18.17.1)
* [npm](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager/): Standard package manager for Node.js (version 9.6.7)
* [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications): a platform that provides tools and resources for developers to create and manage applications that integrate with the Discord platform

**Note:** This project was built using the above versions of the technologies. Please note that using different versions of the technologies may result in compatibility issues or unexpected behavior.
You can update the versions of these technologies by editing the `package.json` file and running `npm install` to install the updated packages.
