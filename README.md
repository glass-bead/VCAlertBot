# VCAlertBot
This Discord bot is designed to address the issue of users joining voice channels without any automatic notification to other server members. While text channel activities generate notifications, joining voice channels (VC) often goes unnoticed. This bot fills that gap by providing real-time notifications when someone joins a voice channel.
